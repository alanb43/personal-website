                        <p class="caption">
                            This project was one I completed in an afternoon. The inspiration for the project was from my initial intrigue in creating a discord 
                            bot and using the discord library in Python, however I was unsure of what to make a bot for. I asked my friend and his older brother
                            heard and told me to make one that essentially ruins any picture sent to a discord server, so that's what I did. This bot will take 
                            an image sent to a server channel by a user, compress it (shrink it and widen it by factors of 5) and send it back to the chat. As a
                            special bonus, it deletes the original sender's message containing the image, so only the compressed photo can be seen. This project
                            only took an hour or so (mainly to learn how to use the library and such), and was a fun gag that I enjoyed making.

                            This project was done in my CSE232 C++ course, and involved my first uses of structs and algorithms in C++. Other data structures 
                            used throughout the project included maps, vectors, and strings. In this project I make a program that takes in a user's shopping 
                            list as well as store information and returns where to find the items on the shopping list at the cheapest price, as well as how 
                            much to bring before leaving to shop. In this project I learned the power of user-defined structures and how much more efficiently 
                            data can be stored, and enjoyed it thoroughly!

                            In this project I utilize the pynput and pyperclip python libraries to create a simple Keylogger. This code should not be used with
                            malicious intent. This keylogger tracks key-strokes in the logger.log file that it creates when the user presses their first key 
                            after running the program. This porject was extremely quick to make and fun to play around with, I saw how the accuracy of my typing 
                            could change for the worse rather quickly with it. Another short and sweet project that I got to learn a bit more Python with!

                            This was another project completed in my CSE232 C++ course, in which I create Self Destructing Message structures that do as they are
                            called: Self Destruct! The purpose of these data structures are to hold sensitive messages and a user-defined maximum amount of views 
                            for the messages, and once a message's views have been expended, the message is gone forever! This project involves my first uses of 
                            classes in C++, as well as accompanying topics such as constructors, overloading operators, and old content such as pointers. This 
                            project was fun and was a great way to become better at making & using classes and different functions within them to create objects 
                            in C++.

                <p id="closer" class="desktop-only">This wesbite was a fun project I started 01/01/2021. I'd like to think of this as a never ending project, 
                  something I'll come back to every once in a while to develop and update in order to test and showcase some of my skills. 
                  <em>Also, if you're a recruiter, please contact me!</em> I am always open to learning about exciting
                  opportunities in the software development & data science/engineering world. Thanks for visiting!
