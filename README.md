# Personal Website 

This project was completed in a couple of weeks during my free time during holiday break (January 2021). I wanted to put my front-end skills to the test to create a fun mock of Amazon, a company I would love to engineer software and data for in the future.

### Features, versions

##### V1 [Began 1/1/2021]

The first version of this site will be suited for desktop viewing only. I want to solidify my design, information, and beginning 'look' before I begin to complicate things.

This design incorporates one main product view page thus far. I hope to add a pre-product page in a later version that this product page will be accessed from.

It should be noted that in V2, making the site responsive for different views will be a priority.
