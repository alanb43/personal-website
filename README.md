# Personal Website 

V1 of this project will be completed in a couple of weeks during my free time during holiday break (January 2021). I wanted to put my front-end skills to the test to create a fun mock of Amazon, a company I would love to engineer software and data for in the future.

### Features, versions

##### V1 [Began 1/1/2021]

The first version of this site will be suited for desktop viewing only. I want to solidify my design, information, and beginning 'look' before I begin to complicate things and worry about those who will access this site on their phones, as these visitors will be very uncommon.

This design incorporates one main product view page thus far. I hope to add other pages perhaps in a later version, if necessary. This page is an Amazon mock, making me the product. I in no way am attempting to use this page to generate revenue, defraud or imitate Amazon, or steal intellectual property. I would love to work as a SWE for Amazon one day.

It should be noted that in V2, making the site responsive for different views will be a priority.
